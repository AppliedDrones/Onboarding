# Onboarding
Welcome to the AppliedDrones research group! This guide will help you set up your development environment and familiarize you with our core tools. The estimated time to complete these tasks is approximately 2 months (depending on your prior experience).

## System Requirements
Ubuntu Humble 22.04 operating system with Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2) installation complete.

Windows machines can be dual booted with Ubuntu ([tutorial here](https://youtu.be/uqZIp4ay-3s?si=rcSGl9dLHojgGoph)). You will need a spare flash drive (32GB) to complete this step. Mac M-series chips are incompatible with Ubuntu because Apple uses a locked-down ARM architecture that doesn't support traditional x86 machine dual-booting.

Install ROS2 Humble edition using the [Debian package guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debs.html).

Complete all the [beginner ROS tutorials](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials.html) and complete environment configuration. Specifically,
- [Edit bash file configuration](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-CLI-Tools/Configuring-ROS2-Environment.html).
- [Install the colcon build tool](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Colcon-Tutorial.html).
- [Create a workspace](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Creating-A-Workspace/Creating-A-Workspace.html).

## NVIDIA Isaac ROS
Familiarize yourself with NVIDIAâ€™s robotics ecosystem by reading the Read the [Isaac ROS overview](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac/ros).

Install the [Isaac ROS suite](https://nvidia-isaac-ros.github.io/getting_started/) and complete simulation tutorials.
