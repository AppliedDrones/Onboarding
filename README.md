# Onboarding
Welcome to the AppliedDrones research group! This guide will help you set up your development environment and familiarize you with our core tools. The estimated time to complete these tasks is approximately 2 months (depending on your prior experience).

## System Requirements
Ubuntu Humble 22.04 (required)

Note for Windows Users: Dual-boot Ubuntu using a spare 32GB flash drive. Follow [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/uqZIp4ay-3s?si=bqlBcCVlpb37reJl).

Note for Mac Users (M-series): M-series chips are incompatible with Ubuntu due to the locked-down ARM architecture. Consider alternatives like a cheap windows laptop or setting up an Ubuntu-based virtual machine using AWS.

## ROS2 Setup and Tutorials
Install Robot Operating System 2(ROS2) Humble edition following the [Debian package guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debs.html).

Complete the [beginner ROS tutorials](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials.html) and configure your environment. Guides of particular importance,
- [Edit bash file configuration](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-CLI-Tools/Configuring-ROS2-Environment.html).
- [Install the colcon build tool](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Colcon-Tutorial.html).
- [Create a workspace](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Creating-A-Workspace/Creating-A-Workspace.html).

## NVIDIA Isaac ROS
